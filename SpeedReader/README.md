Participants & Results:

1. Tony Su  [sushengy]
Results: original(herodotus): 2/5;
         wpm = 250 (1984): 2/5;
         wpm = 350 (holmes): 3/5;
         wpm = 500 (alice): 3/5;
2. Yilin Li  [liyilin]
Results: original(alice): 5/5;
         wpm = 250 (holmes): 5/5;
         wpm = 350 (1984): 2/5;
         wpm = 500 (herodotus): 0/5;
3. Mukund Kalani [kalanimu]
Results: original(1984): 5/5;
         wpm = 250 (herodotus): 3/5;
         wpm = 350 (alice): 5/5;
         wpm = 500 (holmes): 2/5;
Conclusion: The participants were not able to comprehend as well when wpm
was high compared to when it was low. However, at the same time, there were
texts such as alice.txt, that some participants were already aware of, so
they were able to do well in that text even with a high wpm. On the other
hand, the texts such as herodotus.txt, even with a low wpm, it was tougher
to comprehend for the participants. So, the comprehension speed varies with
wpm as well as the difficulty of the text.
